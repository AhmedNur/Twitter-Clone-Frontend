# TwitterCloneFrontend

A simple webapp that copies twitter's look and basic functionality. This angular app works together with a [spring backend](https://github.com/AhmedNur/Twitter-Clone).

# Getting Started

* Ensure that the backend's properties file is filled out to authenticate against your MySQL database.
* Start the spring application and make sure it's running on port 8080.
* Run ng serve in the root of the angular project.
