# TwitterCloneFrontend

A simple webapp that copies twitter's look and basic functionality. This angular app works together with a [spring backend](https://github.com/AhmedNur/Twitter-Clone).

It is still a work in progress, however the main features such as CRUD, liking, retweeting, replying and follwing are all done. In the coming weeks I will be working on features like uploading profile/header pictures, switch to using JWT tokens instead of session based authentication, viewing lists of followers, etc.

# Getting Started

* Ensure that the backend's properties file is filled out to authenticate against your MySQL database.
* Start the spring application and make sure it's running on port 8080.
* Run ng serve in the root of the angular project.
